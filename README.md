##Assignment 1 
This dataset comes from a previous behavioral study conducted in my lab. Each row represents one participant and they experienced either a win or a loss during a videogame round. Following the loss their preference for switching to a different video game was measured on a 5-point Likert scale.
I am interested in understanding how winner and loser effects influence different adaptive behaviors such as switching or playing the same game again. Specifically whether participants are more likely to switch strategies after experiencing a loss compared to after a win. This question relates to broader biological and behavioral theories of perseverance, winner–loser effects, and adaptive responses to failure.
For this assignment, I used this existing dataset to practice data handling and analysis techniques while framing and translating a biological question into a statistical comparison of switching behavior following wins versus losses.

For this assignment I used, StackOverflow to get tips on using ifelse statements and chi square tests, and then streamlined my understanding on them using ChatGPT. 

##Assignment 2
The two scripts I made for this are located in :/hw2Jan16/scripts/assignment_2.R and :/hw2Jan16/scripts/assignment_2_rdsPlot.R. 
The first script looked at the data structure and examined the data for problems. 
The important things to look for were whether there were any missing values, count the number of data points in each conditions (to ensure the data is not overly biased) and to see the spread of the switching preferences. 
To evaluate the data further, I used a histogram plot to see the spread of switching preferences to ensure the spread did not look concerning. 
The second plot was a scatter plot with the positive baseline mood and post experiment positive mood. 
This ensures there is no discrepancy in the positive mood reports as it is important to ensure that those who have reported higher baseline positive moods are not reporting outlier post positive moods. 

The second script was used to create a boxplot that had the treatment on the x axis with the switching preference on the likert scale across the ya axis. 
This has allowed me to visualize whether there is a any meaningful difference amongst individuals who win or lose and their preference for switching after. 

At the moment, I am hoping I will have collected my own data in the new few months which I can use for my experiment. 
My experiment will be similar to this dataset but will not have different treatments as all particiapnts will be in the losing condition. 
Additionally, the switching preference will not be on a likert scale, but simply a binary yes or no. 
I will also be measuring individuals perseverance levels and we will be looking at whether their perseverance levels has any influence on their desire to switch or keep trying after losing.
